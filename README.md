Step 3: Enable Profiling on the Entire Dataset
- Set "Column profiling based on the entire dataset" to ensure a complete data assessment.

Step 4: Check for Data Quality Issues
- Confirmed there were no errors or empty values across columns, ensuring data consistency.

Step 5: Transform Column Names
- Renamed the “Month Name” column to “Month” for simplicity and clarity.

Step 6: Select Theme for Report View
- Chose an appropriate theme to enhance readability and adhere to Velocity Gear's style guidelines.

Step 7: Create Visuals Based on Business Questions
